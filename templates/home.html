          Lutris helps you install and play video games from all eras and from most
          gaming systems. By leveraging and combining existing emulators, engine
          re-implementations and compatibility layers, it gives you a central interface
          to launch all your games.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal of Lutris is to keep our legacy of video games running on our own hardware.
          Video games are a significant part of our cultural heritage and are to be
          considered more than just an entertainment products. Video games have had an influence on
          every other art form, We have experienced video games across multiple generations of
          hardware and software. The fast changing pace of technology relegates games that are
          still of value to relics of the past that would only have worth in their nostalgic values.
          Lutris removes that barrier and aims to provide the best gaming experience for every title
        </p>
        <p>
          Video games have existed on every digital device with a screen and some
          inputs. We are lucky to have software that is capable of recreating the
          environment games need to run on. We do not believe long term software
          conservancy is possible on a closed platform, which is why Lutris is 
          stronly tied to the desktop Linux platform. Open source technology will
          allow you to build a gaming machine capable of standing the test of time
          and containing your very own legacy of games, just like you would have 
          for your music or movie collection.
